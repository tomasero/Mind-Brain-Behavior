##Lecture 5 - Electrical Activity in Neurons
###The organization of the membrane

---

####Neurons transmit information through changes in ion flow
- Ions come in and out
- Cell body sums up all of the ions
- If results larger than threshold --> Action Potential

- Ion
	- Charged atom
	- Either gained or lost an electron

- Neurons have ions inside them and are also surrounded by fluid that has ions
- Cell membranes are made of lipids and not permeable to ions
- What kind of molecules can go through lipid bilayers?


####Normal ion distribution in the body
#####Banana in the ocean

- Intracellular
	- A-
	- K+
- Extracellular
	- Cl-
	- Na+

####Channels
For ions to go through, they must go through specialized molecules called channels or be moved by protein pumps

#####Channels are specific
- We have hundred different types of channels
- The most common type of ions that flow through membrane channels are Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+
- Each channel is permeable to only one or a few ions
	- So if a channel is permeable to Calcium, it won't be permeable to Cl-

#####Movement of ions through channels is passive
- Ions move following their concentration and electrical gradients
- Thus, no external energy needs to be applied for ions to move

#####Channels can be always open or gated
- Channels can be
	- Always open
		- Called Resting or Leak Channels
	- Gated by
		- Voltage
		- Mechanical stimulus
		- Binding of a ligand (Such as a neurotransmitter)
		- Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation

#####The Na+/K+ Pump
- The most important pump in cells
- Maintains normal concentrations of K+ and Na+ inside and outside cell
- Conducts Na+ and K+ **against** their concentration gradients
	- Exchanges 3 Na+ for 2 K+, using 1 ATP
- **Electrogenic**
	- Exchanges 3+ charges for 2, making the cell more negative

####Energy Consumption in the Brain
- Na+/K+ pumps are working all the time
- Since the brain has so many neurons and pumps, the brain is the largest consumer of energy at rest
- At rest, the body required ~700 kilo calories (kcal) per day
	- If you sit without moving a single muscle, your brain will be using most of your energy
	- The brain uses 50% of that (420 kcal)
		- 60% of that (~250 kcal) goes to run the Na+/K+ pumps in the brain
		- Which is equivalent of 36% of the body's total energy requirement at rest
- Amount of power used (energy/time)
	- ~700 kcal = 34 watts
	- ~420 kcal = 20 watts

###Understanding electrical signals


####Neurons use electricity to represent information
- A neuron has different charges inside and outside the cell
- Thus, there is a difference in electrical potential -- > **resting membrane potential**

####Graded Potentials
- Depolarization
	- Decrease in electrical charge across a membrane (more positive)
	- Usually due to the inward flow of sodium
- Hyperpolarization
	- Increase in electrical charge across a membrane (more negative)
	- Usually due to the
		- Inward flow of chloride ions **or**
		- Outward flow of potassium ions

####The Action Potential
- Action Potential
	- Large, brief reversal in polarity of an axon
	- Lasts approximately 1 millisecond (ms)
- Threshold Potential
	- Voltage on a neural membrane at which an action potential is triggered
	- Opening of Na+ and K+ voltage-sensitive channels
	- Approximately -40mV

####Refractory Period
- Action potentials can not be triggered one right after the other
- Period of time where it is not possible to fire another action potential (due to voltage gated Na+ channels being refractory themselves)
- Function
	- Prevents Action Potentials from traveling backwards!
	- In the heart, prevents heart rates from being too fast

####Myelin is Important for Action Potential Conduction
- Vertebrate Axons are covered in myelin
- Myelin works as an insulator, preventing the loss of signal to the environment
- Every once in a while, there is a break in the myelin known as "nodes of Ranvier"
- These nodes are full of voltage gated channels and Na/K pumps
- Action potentials are regenerated at the nodes of Ranvier

####Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
- A devastating demyelinating disorder
- Starts ~30-40 years of age, most common in women
- Autoimmune disorder
- Results in problems in conduction of action potentials to the target, and eventual atrophy of target cells and death of neurons
