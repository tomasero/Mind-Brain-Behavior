#Lecture 3: The Brain

---

##Cellular Components
###The Nervous System is composed of cells
- Neurons, or nerve cells, are the most important part of the nervous system
- Glial cells provide support for neurons

###The Brain in Numbers
- Contains 
	- 100 billion neurons
	- 1 trillion glial cells
- Consumes
	- 25% of body's oxygen
	- 70% of body's glucose 
- For each neuron, ~5000 synapses
- Is less than 2% of body weight

###Neurons have 4 Zones
- **Input zone**: dendrites
	- Receives information from other cells
- **Integration zone**: cell body or soma
	- Region where inputs are combined and transformed
- **Conduction zone**: axon
	- Single axon leads from the cell body and transmits electrical impulses
- **Output zone**: axon terminals
	- Terminals at the end of the axon communicate activity to other cells

###The Neuron Doctrine
- 19th century
	- It was recognized that the cell was the fundamental unit of all living organisms
	- But it wasn't clear whether this was the case for the brain
- Camillo Golgi (1843-1926)
	- Silver stain (Golgi stain)
	- Proposed **reticular theory**
- Santiago Ramon y Cajal
	- Also used Golgi's stain
	- Proposed the **neuron doctrine**

####Synapses
- Neurons communicate with each other through gaps called synapses
- It has been estimated that the human has 10^15 synapses
- Synapses have 3 components
	- **Presynaptic membrane**
		- On the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron
	- **Postsynaptic membrane**
		- On the dendrite or cell body of the postsynaptic neuron
	- **Synaptic cleft**
		- A gap that separates the membranes

####Glial Cells

	Support neuronal activity
	
- **Astrocytes**
	- Star-shaped cells
	- Many processes that receive neuronal input and monitor activity
	- Localizes in the CNS (Central Nervous System)
- **Microglial cells**
	- Small cells
	- Remove debris from injured cells
	- Localized in the CNS
- **Oligodendrocytes**
	- Provide myelination to CNS cells
- **Schwann cells**
	- Provide myelination to PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) cells

####Myelination
- The process in which glial cells wrap axons with a fatty sheath, myelin, to insulate and speed conduction
- **Multiple sclerosis**
	- A demyelinating disease

##Gross anatomy of the brain

###Nervous System
1. Central Nervous System
	- Brain and spinal cord
2. Peripheral Nervous System
	- Neurons and Nerve fibers radiating out beyond the brain and spinal cord

###ANS (Autonomic Nervous System)
- 3 major divisions
	- Sympathetic nervous system
		- In charge of the flight or flight response
	- Parasympathetic nervous system
		- Active in relaxed, non dangerous situations
	- Enteric nervous system
		- Regulares digestion

###Anatomic Divisions of the Nervous System

###Direction of Neural Information Flow
- **Afferent** (Incoming)
	- Coming into CNS
	- Sensory information
- **Efferent** (Outgoing)
	- Leaving the CNS
	- Motor

###The Brain
- Dominated by 2 cerebral hemispheres
- **Cerebral Cortex**
	- Outermost layer of the cerebral hemispheres
	- The brain surface has 2 types of areas
		- **Gyrus**: Ridged or raised portion of the convoluted brain surface
		- **Sulcus**: Furrow of the convoluted brain surface
- 4 lobes
	- **Frontal**
		- Impulse control, decision making
		- Contains motor cortex
	- **Parietal**
		- Contains somatosensory cortex (pain, touch temperature)
	- **Occipital**
		- Visual processing
	- **Temporal**
		- Auditory processing and memory

###The Meninges
- Surround the brain and spinal cord, protecting them
- The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates within the subarachnoid space

<img src="./media/Meninges.png" width="70%" alt="Meninges">

###The Ventricular System
- Series of chambers filled with CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)
- CSF has 2 main functions
	- Acts as a sock absorber
	- Provides an exchange medium between blood and brain

##Structure of the cortex

###Gray Matter vs White Matter
- 2 colors of brain tissue
	- **White matter**: consists mostly of axons with white myelin sheaths
	- **Gray matter**: contains more cell bodies and dendrites, which lack myelin

<img src="./media/Brain_Tissue.png" width="80%" alt="Brain Tissue">

###Layers of Cerebral Cortex
- **Neocortex** (a.k.a. cortex)
	- 6 distinct layers
- Cortical layers are distinguished by
	- Type of neuron
	- Pattern of dendrites or axons
- There are other cortices with 3-4 layers or unlayered

###Cytoarchitectonic Map
- Brodmann defined areas by organization and characteristic of cells
- The simplest sensory perceptions of touch (red), vision (purple), and hearing (orange)
