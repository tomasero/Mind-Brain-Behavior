###Integrating Electrical Signals

**Neurons can receive several inputs** | **Inputs can be integrated across time and across synapses**

###Neurotransmission
#####Chemical vs Electrical Synapses
<br>
####Varieties of Synapses
- Synapses vary widely, each type is specialized in
	- Location
	- Structure
	- Function
	- Target
- Through connections to the dendrites, cell body, or axon of a neuron, transmitters can control the actions of the neuron in different ways
	1. **Dendrodendritic**: Dendrites to dendrites
	2. **Axodendritic**: Axon terminal to dendrites
	3. **Axoextracellular**: Axon terminal to extracellular fluid
	4. **Axosomatic**: Axon terminal to cell body
	5. **Axosynaptic**: Axon terminal to another terminal
	6. **Axoaxonic**: Axon terminal to another axon
	7. **Axosecretory**: Axon terminal to capillaries (directly into blood)

####Structure of Chemical Synapses
- Chemical Synapse
	- Junction where messenger molecules (neurotransmitters) are released from one neuron to excite/inhibit the next neuron
	- Majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system are chemical
- Neurotransmitter
	- Chemical released by a neuron onto a target with an excitatory or inhibitory effect
	- Outside the CNS, many of these chemicals circulate in the blood stream as hormones (distant targets, slower action than neurotransmitters)
- Experiment: Otto Loewi (1921)
	- Frog heart experiement
	- Role of the vagus nerve and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in slowing heart rate
- Acetylcholine
	- First neurotransmitter discovered in the PNS and CNS
	- Activates skeletal muscles in the somatic nervous system
	- May excite/inhibit internal organs in the autonomic nervous system

####Structure of Electrical Synapses
- Gap junction
	- Fused presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane
	- Allows ions (electrical messages) to pass directly from one neuron to the next
- Electrical Synapses are fast
- These types of synapses are less common

####Steps in Synaptic Transmission
1. **Synthesis**
	- Some neurotransmitters are transported from the cell nucleus to the terminal button
	- Others, made from building clocks imported into the terminal, are packaged into vesicles there
2. **Release**
	- In response to an action potential, the transmitter is released across the membrane by exocytosis
3. **Receptor action**
	- Transmitter cross the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor
4. **Inactivation**
	- Transmitter is either taken back into the terminal or inactivated in the synaptic cleft

####Excess Neurotransmitter
- Accomplished in at least four ways
	- Diffusion away from synaptic cleft
	- Degradation by enzymes in synaptic cleft
	- Reabsorption into presynaptic neuron for subsequent reuse
	- Taken up by neighboring glial cells
