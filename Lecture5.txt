###Integrating Electrical Signals

**Neurons can receive several inputs** | **Inputs can be integrated across time and across synapses**

###Neurotransmission
#####Chemical vs Electrical Synapses
<br>
####Varieties of Synapses
- Synapses vary widely, each type is specialized in
	- Location
	- Structure
	- Function
	- Target
- Through connections to the dendrites, cell body, or axon of a neuron, transmitters can control the actions of the neuron in different ways
	1. **Dendrodendritic**: Dendrites to dendrites
	2. **Axodendritic**: Axon terminal to dendrites
	3. **Axoextracellular**: Axon terminal to extracellular fluid
	4. **Axosomatic**: Axon terminal to cell body
	5. **Axosynaptic**: Axon terminal to another terminal
	6. **Axoaxonic**: Axon terminal to another axon
	7. **Axosecretory**: Axon terminal to to capillaries (directly into blood)

####Structure of Chemical Synapses
- Chemical Synapse
	- Junction where messenger molecules (neurotransmitters) are released from one neuron to excite/inhibit the next neuron
	- Majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system are chemical
- Neurotransmitter
	- Chemical released by a neuron onto a target with an excitatory or inhibitory effect
	- Outside the bloodstream as h
