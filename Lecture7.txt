##Lecture 7
#####How do Drugs and Hormones affect the Brain and Behavior

---

###Drugs
- Chemicals that have physiological effects
- Includes from herbal teas to drugs of abuse such as heroine or cocaine

####History
#####Drugs in Early Times
- Earliest experiences with psychoactive drugs came from tasting naturally growing plants

#####Drugs in the 19th Century
- Psychoactive drugs widely used, principally in the form of patent medicines
- By the end of the century the risks of drug dependence began to be recognized

####Classification of Psychoactive Drugs
- Drugs are classified by its most pronounced behavioral or psychoactive effect
	- Antianxiety Agents and Sedative Hypnotics
	- Antipsychotic Agents
	- Antidepressants/Mood Stabilizers
	- Opioid Analgesics
	- Psychotropics

####Antianxiety Agents and Sedative Hypnotics
- At low doses, they depress inhibitory parts of the brain, leading to disinhibition or relaxation and talkativeness
- As the dose is increased, the neural functions become depressed, leading to uncoordinated movements and unconsciousness
- Includes
	- Alcohol
	- Barbiturates
	- Benzodiazepines (Valium)
	- Ketamine (Special K)

####Antipsychotic Agents
- Psychosis: Behavioral disorders
	- e.g., Schizophrenia (1 in 100 people)
- Antipsychotics:
	- Can calm psychotic patients
	- e.g., Haloperidol (Block D2 receptors)

####Antidepressants and Mood Stabilizers

#####Major depression

- Mood disorder characterized by
	- Prolonged feelings of worthlessness and guilt
	- Disruption of normal eating habits
	- Sleep disturbances
	- General slowing of behavior
	- Frequent thoughts of suicide
- Common: ~6% of adult population
- Twice as common in women as in men
- Most Antidepressants increase serotonin and norepinephrine systems

#####Bipolar disorder

- Mood disorder characterized by
	- Period of depression alternating with normal period and periods of intense excitation
- Mood stabilizers mute the intensity of one pole of the disorder, making the other pole less likely to occur
- Mechanisms are not well understood
	- Lithium may stimulate neuronal repair
	- Valproate may stimulate GABA activity

####Opioid Analgesics
- Analgesic (pain killers) drugs that produce a relaxed dream-like state and can lead to sleep
- A.K.A. **Narcotics**
- They are different from depressants because there is no reckless abandon, slurred speech or staggering. They act on different parts of the brain
- Includes
	- Morphine
	- Codeine
	- Methadone
	- Heroin

####Psychotropic Drugs (Behavioral Stimulants)
- Produce wakefulness and a sense of energy and well-being
- The most powerful one can lead to manic state of excitement combined with paranoia and hallucinations
- Includes
	- Cocaine
	- Amphetamines
	- Caffeine

####Psychotropic Drugs (Hallucinogens)
- Produce altered perceptions, including unusual visual sensations and quite often changes in the perception of one's body
- Includes
	- Mescaline
	- LSD
	- PCP

####Nicotine
- Mild stimulant
- Some relaxant properties

####Marijuana
- Relaxant but different from all other categories
- At high doses it can produce hallucinations
- Endocannabinoid Receptors (CB1) are distributed widely in the brain

###Pharmacokinetics
- While the chemical structure of a drugs determines its action, several other factors are also very important
- E.g., The dose of the drug administered is important, but what really matters is how much of the drug remains in the blood free to bind targets (**bioavailability**)
- **Pharmacokinetics**: The study of the factors affecting bioavailability

####Routes of drug administration
- Affects when the drug will reach its target and how much of it will get there
	- Oral administration
	- Intravenous Administration (IV injection)
	- Intramuscular Administration (IM injection)
	- Intraperitoneal Administration (IP injection)
	- Subcutaneous Administration (SC injection)
	- Inhalation drugs
	- Topic Administration
	- Special injection methods (intracranial, epidural, etc)

####All drugs will be distributed by the circulatory system
- Ingested drugs will have to go to
	1. Stomach (Acid, enzymes)
	2. Intestine (pH=7.3, enzymes)
	3. Liver (detoxifier)
- Only after that they will enter the circulatory system

####Distribution of drugs is fairly generalized through capillaries
- Once drugs are in the blood they will start "leaking" through capillary holes into all tissues
- The chemical nature of the drug is irrelevant at this point
- Thus, areas with more blood will have more drug (heart, brain, kidneys, liver)

####Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)
- Selective barriers
- Consists of capillaries that are bound **very** tight so things can't get through
- Capillaries are surrounded by glial cells that make it harder for things to go through
- Lipid soluble substances can still go through
- There are special carriers for the rest

####The Placenta
- Connects the fetus with the mother's uterine wall
- Brings nutrients and gases to the fetus
- Removes wastes
- Lipid soluble substances will diffuse easily through the placenta
- Water soluble ones will have a harder time

####Drugs cross the Placenta affecting the fetus
- Alcohol
	- Fetal alcohol syndrome
	- Decreased birth weight
	- Adverse cognitive outcomes
	- Poorer linguistic abilities
	- Deficits in attention and memory
- Cocaine
	- Decreased neonatal head circumference
	- Birth weight
	- Prematurity
	- Growth retardation
	- Fetal loss
	- Decreased adaptability to stress
	- Impaired attention
- Marijuana
	- Decreased birth weight and length
	- Deleterious cognitive and attention effects in some preschool and early school-age samples
- Nicotine
	- Physical, cognitive and behavioral effects in offspring
- Heroin
	- Neonatal abstinence syndrome
- Cocaine
	- Intrathecal morphine associated with fetal bradycardia
- Caffeine
	- Prospective cohort: low birth weight, small head circumference

####Drug Elimination/Half-Life
- Drugs are eliminated from the body by several mechanisms
- These include metabolism and excretion of drugs and its metabolites
- **Half-Life**: The amount of time required to remove 50% of the drug from blood

####Biotransformation of Drugs
- Most drugs are altered by the body's enzymes before they are excreted
- These changes take place in many organs, including
	- Liver (most important)
	- Stomach
	- Kidney
	- Brain
	- Intestine
	- Blood plasma

####The Liver
- Plays a major role in drug transformation
- Contains large amounts of enzymes that can metabolize a wide variety of compounds
- These are called **microsomal enzymes**
- One of the most important microsomal enzymes is the **cytochrome p450** enzyme family
- There are 30+ different enzymes and they oxidize a wide variety of drugs

###Pharmacology of Synaptic Transmission
<br>
####How do drugs exert their effects?
- This is done by altering synaptic transmission
- It can change the
	- Levels of neurotransmitters made
	- Amount of neurotransmitters available in the synapse
	- Sensitivity of the receptors
	- Availability of receptors (e.g., by blocking them)
- Effects can be either acute or chronic
- Terminology
	- **Agonist**: Substance that **ENHANCES** the function of a synapse
	- **Antagonist:**: Substance that **BLOCKS/DECREASES** the function of a synapse

####Characteristics of Receptor-Ligand Interactions
- Very specific
- The better they match the ligand binding site, the better and stronger the interactin

####Depression and SSRIs
- Depression is usually diagnosed through behavioral assessment of subjects (sleep patterns, mood, changes in feeding behavior) 
- The most prescribed treatment is pharmacological
	- E.g., Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors

####Antidepressants
#####Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors**
- Block the enzyme MAO from degrading neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin

#####Tricyclic Antidepressants
- First-generation antidepressants with a chemical structure characterized by three rings that block serotonin reuptake transporter proteins

#####Second-Generation Antidepressants
- Action similar to first-generation antidepressants
- More selective in action on the serotonin reuptake proteins
- A.K.A. Atypical antidepressants

#####Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SRRIs)
- Block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic terminal

####Antidepressants: Questions remain
- Although antidepressants affect synapses very quickly, their antidepressive actions take weeks to develop
- Prozac, an SSRI, enhances neurogenesis in the hippocampus
- ~20% of patients with depression fail to respond to antidepressants, suggesting that depression can likely have many causes

####Alcohol and Depressant Drugs
- Many of them act on the GABA ionotropic receptor, which is a GABA gated ion channel
- When open, the channel allows chloride to come into the cell, which makes it harder to fire an action potential
- These drugs increase the amount of chloride coming in
- Because they do not act on the same sites of the receptor, they potentiate each other
- Therefore it is dangerous to consume them together
- In addition, many of the drugs that affect GABAergic signaling are metabolized by the same enzymes, which leads to **cross-tolerance**

####Amphetamine and Cocaine
- They increase dopaminergic signaling by overlapping mechanisms
