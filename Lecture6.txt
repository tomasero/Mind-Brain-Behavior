#####Neurotransmission

---

###Varieties of Neurotransmitters
- Over 50 different kinds identified
- Some are inhibitory at one location and excitatory at another
- More than one neurotransmitter may be active at a single synapse
- No simple one-to-one relationship between a single neurotransmitter and a single behavior

###Small-Molecule Transmitters
- Class of quick-acting neurotransmitters
- Synthesized from dietary nutrients and packaged ready for use in axon terminals
- Examples:
	- Acetylcholine (ACh)
	- Amines
		- Norepinephrine (NE)
		- Epinephrine (EP)
		- Serotonin (5-HT)
	- Amino Acids
		- Glutamate (Glu)
		- Gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)
		- Glycine (Gly)

####Glutamate and GABA
- Most important neurotransmitters for information transmission in the CNS
- Glutamate
	- Usually excitatory
- GABA
	- Usually inhibitory

####Peptide Transmitters
- Act as hormones that respond to stress
- Enable a mother to bond with her infant
- Regulate eating, drinking, pleasure and pain
- Contribute to learning
- Opiates such as morphine and heroin mimic the actions of natural brain peptides

####Transmitter Gases
- Neither stored in synaptic vesicles nor released from them
- Synthesized in cell, as needed
- Easily crosses cell membrane
- E.g., Nitric Oxide (NO)
	- Viagra enhances the effects of this neurotransmitter in the blood vessels in the penis

####Postsynaptic Neuron
- Interprets the chemical message
- On postsynaptic side, a neurotransmitter may
	- Depolarize the postsynaptic membrane
		- Causing excitatory action on the postsynaptic neuron
		- EPSP (Excitatory PostSynaptic Potential)
	- Hyperpolarize the post synaptic membrane
		- Causing inhibitory action on the post synaptic neuron
		- IPSP (Inhibitory PostSynaptic Potential)
	- Initiate other chemical reactions that 
		- Modulate either the excitatory or inhibitory effect **or**
		- Influence other functions of the receiving neuron
	
####Receptors
- Receptor proteins recognize transmitters and their mimics
- Two basic kinds of neurotransmitter receptors

**Ionotropic** | **Metabotropic**
--- | ---
Fast | Slow
Quickly change shape | When activated they alter chemical reactions in the cell
Open or close an ion channel when the transmitter molecule binds | Use a system of *second messengers* to open ion channels

####Learning: Changes in Synapses
- Presynaptic Neuron
	- Increased axonal transport
	- Increase size or area of terminal
	- Increase in number of synaptic vesicles
	- Increase in density of contact zones
	- Change in size of synaptic cleft
- Postsynaptic Neuron
	- Increase in size or area of spine
	- Change in stem length and width
	- Increase in protein transport for spine construction

###Activating Systems in the CNS
####Cholinergic System
- Acetylcholine
- Produced in the Basal forebrain nuclei and Midbrain nuclei
- Active in maintaining attention
- Important for learning and memory, specially in adults
- A decrease in cholinergic activity is seen in Alzheimer's Disease

####Noradrenergic System
- Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine)
- Produced in the Locus coeruleus
- Plays a role in learning memory (particularly in adults)
- Important in emotional processing
- Has been implied in different neurological disorders
	- Depression (less)
	- ADHD (less)
	- Mania (excess)

####Dopaminergic Systems
#####Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic System
- Produced in the Substantia nigra
- Involved in movement
- Related to Parkisonism

#####Mesolimbic Dopaminergic System
- Produced in the Ventral Tegmentum Area (VTA)
- Important in reward processing
- Has been linked to addiction and schitzophrenia

#####6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
- Neurotoxin
- Destroys dopaminergic neurons

#####Lesions of the Ascending Dopaminergic pathways
- Results in behavioral deficits
- Animals show
	- Sensory neglect
		- Little attention to the environment
	- Motivational deficits
		- Little interest in eating food or drinking water
	- Motor impairments
		- Difficulty initiating voluntary movements
		- Similar to Parkinson's

#####Drug Abuse
- Drugs that are abused increase mesolimbic dopamine activity, either directly or indirectly
- Drugs that blunt abuse and addiction decrease mesolimbic dopamine activity

####Serotonergic System
- Serotonin
- Plays a role in
	- Wakefulness
	- Learning
	- Mood
- Might be related to OCD and schitzophrenia

###Parkinson's
- First described in 1817 by James Parkinson
- It is a *hypokinetic* movement disorder
- Symptoms arise due to the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons
- As a result, the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia is abnormally high
- Incorrect coordination of movement
- Symptoms
	- Diminished facial expressions
	- Lack of smooth movements
	- Movement initiation is difficult (akinesia)
	- Reduced velocity and amplitude of movements (bradykinesia)
	- Tremor at rest
	- Impaired balance

####The Frozen Addicts
- 1982: Several young drug addicts were admitted to a hospital with symptoms resembling parkinson's
- Their symptoms responded to L-DOPA
- The heroin they consumer was contaminated with MPTP
- Injection of MPTP to rats and nice had no effect but in monkeys it resulted in "parkinson's"

####Causes
- While the symptoms arise from the death of the dopaminergic neurons, it is not known what causes this
- Recently it has been suggested that it could present a genetic component
	- Mutations in 3 genes have been implicated in rare forms of the disease but this doesn't account for most of the cases of PD
- These genes could be therapeutic targets in the future

####Treatments
- Administration of L-DOPA
	- A dopamine precursor
	- Caveat: The dose had to be constantly increased and it becomes ineffective after ~5 years
- Surgical lesioning
	- Lesioning of specific areas of the basal ganglia can increase the ability of the person to move
- Deep brain stimulation
- Stem cells
