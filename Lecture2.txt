###Understanding Human Consciousness:
####A Physiological Approach  
  
- **Corpus Callosum**
	- Large bundle of nerve fibers that connect corresponding parts of one side of the brain with those of the other
- E.g.
	- Flower on the left side of visual field
		- Right visual cortex (contralateral) will see it first
		- Then send information to left visual cortex
	- Flower on the right side of visual field
		- Left visual cortex will see it first
		- Then send information to right visual cortex

- **Epilepsy**
	- In some cases of epilepsy, electrical activity propagates through the corpus callosum, bouncing back and forth between the two hemispheres, causing a generalized epileptic seizure
- **Split-Brain Operation**
	- Neurosurgeons discovered that cutting the corpus callosum greatly reduced the frequency of epileptic seizures (Sperry & Gazzaniga)
- **Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum**
	- One can be born without a corpus callosum but it is very rare

###What happens if the two hemispheres cannot communicate?

- Word on the **left** side of visual field
	- Right visual cortex (contralateral) will see it
	- Information **cannot** be sent back to left visual cortex
	- Can't say what is seen, but can draw it with left hand
	- Can he draw it with right hand too?
- Word on the **right** side of visual field
	- Left visual cortex will see it
	- Information **cannot** be sent back to right visual cortex
	- Can say what is seen

##Why do we behave the way we do?

###Natural Selection and Evolution
- Charles Darwin (1809-1882)
	- Formulated the principles of *natural selection and evolution*, which revolutionized biology
- **Natural Selection**
	- Gradual process by which biological traits become either more or less common in a population
	- It is a function of the effect of inherited traits on the differential reproductive success of organisms interacting with their environment
	- Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution

###From the perspective of behavior...
- Behaviors that are advantageous either because they increase the reproductive success or likelihood of survival till reproductive age would be selected for
- It might be advantageous to have those behaviors **hard coded** (already genetically encoded) --> **Fixed Action Patterns**

###Fixed Action Patterns
- Sequence of unlearned, innate behaviors that is unchangeable
	- Once initiated, it is usually carried to completion
- **Trigger Stimulus**
	- Stimulus that triggers the stereotypes behavior

<img src="./media/Fixed_Action_Patterns.png" width="100%" alt="Fixed Action Patterns">

- E.g. Male Stickleback Fish
	- Behavior
		- A male stickleback fish attacks other male sticklebacks that invade its nesting territory
	- Proximate cause
		- The red belly of the intruding male acts as a **sign stimulus** that releases aggression in a male stickleback
	- Ultimate cause
		- By chasing away other male sticklebacks, a male decreases the chance that eggs laid in his nesting territory will be fertilized by another male

###Nature vs Nurture
- All of our cells contain the same original set of genetic information, which we inherited from our parents
- The genetic information is contained in chromosomes, which are a large structure of DNA
- Only 2% of our DNA encodes for "useful" stuff
- Everything our cells have (membranes, pigments, ability to move, ability to transport oxygen, etc) is encoded in the DNA
- Different cells in our body use specific sections of DNA

###Different cells exist because they express different genes
- **Gene**
	1. Part of the DNA that encodes something useful
	2. If you think of the molecule of DNA as a string of random letters, a **gene** would be a set of letters that actually spell out a word

- **Cloning**
	- If all cells have the same genetic information but only "read" some of it, we should be able to make a full organism from the genetic information in just one cell

###Fixed Action Patterns and Genes

- If some behaviors are **Hard Wired**...
	- Cells must contain genes that result in neurons connecting in specific ways so that when a trigger stimulus is detected, it triggers activity of a specific set of neurons --> **Fixed Action Patterns**
- If this is the case...
	- We might be able to change the behavior by just changing one gene
- For a few behaviors this is true...
	- But most behaviors seem to result from complex interactions of genes and environment 
	- Our brain is shaped to our environment through our lives
- **Fly Courtship Behavior**
	- Mutating one gene makes females behave as males
	- They show a complex sequence of behaviors that are aimed at "courting" females"

###Characteristics in humans determined by one gene

- Monogenic Traits
	- Determined by one gene
	- E.g.
		- Cleft in chin
		- Hairline
		- Freckles
- But most are not
	- If we cannot yet understand how some genes work together to determine something as simple as height
	- Imagine understanding behavioral characteristics

###Nature & Nurture
- **Heritability**
	- Percentage of the variation in a characteristic that can be attributed to genetic factors
	- Calculated by comparing **concordance rate** for types of twins
		- Identical twins share 100% of their genes
		- Fraternal twins share about 50% of their genes
	- Some estimated heritability rates are
		- Intelligence: 50%
		- Schizophrenia: 60-90%
		- Height: 90%
- About half of the variability in behavioral characteristics is due to heredity; the other half is due to environmental influences
- **Vulnerability model**: Influence of genes is only partial
	- Genes contribute a predisposition for the disorder
	- Combination of genes & environmental factors determines whether the individual develops the disorder
- Most scientists reject the nature-vs-nurture concept; they conclude that heredity and environment interact to influence behavior
